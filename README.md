# Stripe API Skills

[Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) in [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format for AI agents.

**Stripe API Version:** `2026-01-28.clover`

## Usage

Point your AI agent to read `stripe-api/SKILL.md` as the entry point.

## About This Project

This skill is generated by [openapi-to-skills](https://github.com/neutree-ai/openapi-to-skills), serving as a real-world example of converting production-grade API documentation.

### Why Agent Skills Format?

The original Stripe OpenAPI specification is a **7.2 MB** JSON file - too large for most LLM context windows and inefficient even when it fits. Agent Skills format enables progressive disclosure:

| Metric | Original | Agent Skills |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Source | 1 file (7.2 MB) | 2,135 files |
| Resources | - | 77 index files |
| Operations | 588 (all in one) | 588 individual files |
| Schemas | 1,315 (all in one) | 1,468 individual files |

Agents load only what they need - start with the overview, drill into specific resources, then read individual operations. This minimizes context usage while maintaining full API coverage.
