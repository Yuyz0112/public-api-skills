**Resource:** [issues](../resources/issues.md)
**List issue comments for a repository**
**Operation ID:** `issues/list-comments-for-repo`

You can use the REST API to list comments on issues and pull requests for a repository. Every pull request is an issue, but not every issue is a pull request.

By default, issue comments are ordered by ascending ID.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
- **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
- **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
