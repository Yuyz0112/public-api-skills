# DELETE /users/{username}/packages/{package_type}/{package_name}

**Resource:** [packages](../resources/packages.md)
**Delete a package for a user**
**Operation ID:** `packages/delete-package-for-user`

Deletes an entire package for a user. You cannot delete a public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.

If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, the authenticated user must have admin permissions to the package. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. For more information, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
