# Stories

*See [our forum post](https://forum.asana.com/t/no-more-parsing-story-text-new-fields-on-stories/42924) for more info on when conditional fields are returned.*

A story represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take actions such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between projects. "Comments" are also a form of user-generated story.
