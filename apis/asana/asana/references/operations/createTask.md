# POST /tasks

**Resource:** [Tasks](../resources/Tasks.md)
**Create a task**
**Operation ID:** `createTask`

<b>Required scope: </b><code>tasks:write</code>

Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with a
data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any
unspecified fields will take on default values.

Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

## Parameters
