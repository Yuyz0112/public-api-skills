# GET /user_task_lists/{user_task_list_gid}/tasks

**Resource:** [Tasks](../resources/Tasks.md)
**Get tasks from a user task list**
**Operation ID:** `getTasksForUserTaskList`

<b>Required scope: </b><code>tasks:read</code>

Returns the compact list of tasks in a user’s My Tasks list.
*Note: Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access to them.*
*Note: Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)*
