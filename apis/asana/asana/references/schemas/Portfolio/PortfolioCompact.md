# PortfolioCompact

A *portfolio* gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most recent [project status](/reference/project-statuses) update.
Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 1500 items and, like projects, a max of 20 custom fields.

**Type:** object
