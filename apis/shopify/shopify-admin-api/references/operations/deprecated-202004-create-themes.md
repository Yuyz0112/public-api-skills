# POST /admin/api/2020-04/themes.json

**Resource:** [online-store/theme](../resources/online-store-theme.md)
**Creates a theme by providing the public URL of a ZIP file that contains the theme.
          A new theme is always unpublished by default. To publish a theme when you create it, include
          "role": "main" in the POST request. The theme will be published only after all
          of its files have been extracted and stored by Shopify, which might take a couple of minutes.**
