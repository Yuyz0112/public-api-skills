# notification_event_data

**Type:** object

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `object` | object | Yes | Object containing the API resource relevant to the event. For example, an `invoice.created` event will have a full [invoice object](https://api.stripe.com#invoice_object) as the value of the object key. |
| `previous_attributes` | object | No | Object containing the names of the updated attributes and their values prior to the event (only included in events of type `*.updated`). If an array attribute has any updated elements, this object contains the entire array. In Stripe API versions 2017-04-06 or earlier, an updated array attribute in this object includes only the updated array elements. |
