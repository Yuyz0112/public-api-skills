# GET /rest/api/3/user/search/query/key

**Resource:** [User search](../resources/User-search.md)
**Find user keys by query**
**Operation ID:** `findUserKeysByQuery`

Finds users with a structured query and returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of user keys.

This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the structured query. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the structured query, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

The query statements are:

 *  `is assignee of PROJ` Returns the users that are assignees of at least one issue in project *PROJ*.
 *  `is assignee of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are assignees on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `is reporter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are reporters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `is watcher of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are watchers on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `is voter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that are voters on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `is commenter of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have posted a comment on the issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `is transitioner of (PROJ-1, PROJ-2)` Returns users that have performed a transition on issues *PROJ-1* or *PROJ-2*.
 *  `[propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"` Returns users with the entity property value. For example, if user property `location` is set to value `{"office": {"country": "AU", "city": "Sydney"}}`, then it's possible to use `[location].office.city is "Sydney"` to match the user.

The list of issues can be extended as needed, as in *(PROJ-1, PROJ-2, ... PROJ-n)*. Statements can be combined using the `AND` and `OR` operators to form more complex queries. For example:

`is assignee of PROJ AND [propertyKey].entity.property.path is "property value"`
