# rulesets_SetCacheSettingsReadTimeout

A timeout value between two successive read operations to use for your origin server. Historically, the timeout value between two read options from Cloudflare to an origin server is 100 seconds. If you are attempting to reduce HTTP 524 errors because of timeouts from an origin server, try increasing this timeout value.
