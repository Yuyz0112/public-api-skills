# zones_schemas-polish

Removes metadata and compresses your images for faster page load times. Basic (Lossless): Reduce the size of PNG, JPEG, and GIF files - no impact on visual quality. Basic + JPEG (Lossy): Further reduce the size of JPEG files for faster image loading. Larger JPEGs are converted to progressive images, loading a lower-resolution image first and ending in a higher-resolution version. Not recommended for hi-res photography sites.
