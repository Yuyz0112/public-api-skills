# access_read_service_tokens_from_header

Allows matching Access Service Tokens passed HTTP in a single header with this name.
This works as an alternative to the (CF-Access-Client-Id, CF-Access-Client-Secret) pair of headers.
The header value will be interpreted as a json object similar to: 
  {
    "cf-access-client-id": "88bf3b6d86161464f6509f7219099e57.access.example.com",
    "cf-access-client-secret": "bdd31cbc4dec990953e39163fbbb194c93313ca9f0a6e420346af9d326b1d2a5"
  }


**Type:** primitive
