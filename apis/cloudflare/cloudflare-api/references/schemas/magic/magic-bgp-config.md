# magic_bgp_config

**Type:** object

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `customer_asn` | integer (int32) | Yes | ASN used on the customer end of the BGP session |
| `extra_prefixes` | string[] | No | Prefixes in this list will be advertised to the customer device, in addition to the routes in the Magic routing table. |
| `md5_key` | string | No | MD5 key to use for session authentication.

Note that *this is not a security measure*. MD5 is not a valid security mechanism, and the
key is not treated as a secret value. This is *only* supported for preventing
misconfiguration, not for defending against malicious attacks.

The MD5 key, if set, must be of non-zero length and consist only of the following types of
character:

* ASCII alphanumerics: `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
* Special characters in the set `'!@#$%^&*()+[]{}<>/.,;:_-~`= \|`

In other words, MD5 keys may contain any printable ASCII character aside from newline (0x0A),
quotation mark (`"`), vertical tab (0x0B), carriage return (0x0D), tab (0x09), form feed
(0x0C), and the question mark (`?`). Requests specifying an MD5 key with one or more of
these disallowed characters will be rejected. |
