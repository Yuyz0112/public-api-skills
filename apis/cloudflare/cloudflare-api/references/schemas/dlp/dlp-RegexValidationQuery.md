# dlp_RegexValidationQuery

**Type:** object

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `max_match_bytes` | integer (int32) | No | Maximum number of bytes that the regular expression can match.

If this is `null` then there is no limit on the length. Patterns can use
`*` and `+`. Otherwise repeats should use a range `{m,n}` to restrict
patterns to the length. If this field is missing, then a default length
limit is used.

Note that the length is specified in bytes. Since regular expressions
use UTF-8 the pattern `.` can match up to 4 bytes. Hence `.{1,256}`
has a maximum length of 1024 bytes. |
| `regex` | string | Yes |  |
