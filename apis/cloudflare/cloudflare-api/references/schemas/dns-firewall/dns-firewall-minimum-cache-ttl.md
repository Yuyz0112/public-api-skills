# dns-firewall_minimum_cache_ttl

By default, Cloudflare attempts to cache responses for as long as
indicated by the TTL received from upstream nameservers. This setting
sets a lower bound on this duration. For caching purposes, lower TTLs
will be increased to the minimum value defined by this setting.

This setting does not affect the TTL value in the DNS response
Cloudflare returns to clients. Cloudflare will always forward the TTL
value received from upstream nameservers.

Note that, even with this setting, there is no guarantee that a
response will be cached for at least the specified duration. Cached
responses may be removed earlier for capacity or other operational
reasons.
