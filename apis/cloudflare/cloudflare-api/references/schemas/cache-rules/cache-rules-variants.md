# cache-rules_variants

Variant support enables caching variants of images with certain file extensions in addition to the original. This only applies when the origin server sends the 'Vary: Accept' response header. If the origin server sends 'Vary: Accept' but does not serve the variant requested, the response will not be cached. This will be indicated with BYPASS cache status in the response headers.
