# load-balancing_session_affinity_ttl

Time, in seconds, until a client's session expires after being created. Once the expiry time has been reached, subsequent requests may get sent to a different origin server. The accepted ranges per `session_affinity` policy are: - `"cookie"` / `"ip_cookie"`: The current default of 23 hours will be used unless explicitly set. The accepted range of values is between [1800, 604800]. - `"header"`: The current default of 1800 seconds will be used unless explicitly set. The accepted range of values is between [30, 3600]. Note: With session affinity by header, sessions only expire after they haven't been used for the number of seconds specified.

**Type:** primitive
