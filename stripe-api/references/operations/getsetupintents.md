| Name | In | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `attach_to_self` | query | boolean | No | If present, the SetupIntent's payment method will be attached to the in-context Stripe Account.

It can only be used for this Stripe Account’s own money movement flows like InboundTransfer and OutboundTransfers. It cannot be set to true when setting up a PaymentMethod for a Customer, and defaults to false when attaching a PaymentMethod to a Customer. |
| `created` | query | any | No | A filter on the list, based on the object `created` field. The value can be a string with an integer Unix timestamp, or it can be a dictionary with a number of different query options. |

| `customer_account` | query | string | No | Only return SetupIntents for the account specified by this customer ID. |
| `ending_before` | query | string | No | A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list. |
| `expand` | query | string[] | No | Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded. |
| `limit` | query | integer | No | A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10. |
| `payment_method` | query | string | No | Only return SetupIntents that associate with the specified payment method. |
| `starting_after` | query | string | No | A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list.
