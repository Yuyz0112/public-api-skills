# POST /v1/payouts

**Resource:** [payouts](../resources/payouts.md)
**Create a payout**
**Operation ID:** `PostPayouts`

<p>To send funds to your own bank account, create a new payout object. Your <a href="#balance">Stripe balance</a> must cover the payout amount. If it doesn’t, you receive an “Insufficient Funds” error.</p>

<p>If your API key is in test mode, money won’t actually be sent, though every other action occurs as if you’re in live mode.</p>

<p>If you create a manual payout on a Stripe account that uses multiple payment source types, you need to specify the source type balance that the payout draws from. The <a href="#balance_object">balance object</a> details available and pending amounts by source type.</p>
