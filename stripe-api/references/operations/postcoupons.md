**Operation ID:** `PostCoupons`

<p>You can create coupons easily via the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons">coupon management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.</p>

<p>A coupon has either a <code>percent_off</code> or an <code>amount_off</code> and <code>currency</code>. If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency> will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it.</p>
